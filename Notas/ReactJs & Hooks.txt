Rules of Using Hooks

1)  No nested hooks calls

Wrong:
if(true) {useEffect(()=>{return value})}

Right:
useEffect(()=> true ? return value : null)

Main Hooks Overview

- useState()
Similar to this.setState()
Updates local component state.

- useEffect()
Similar to componentDidMount()
Use when you want to call function automatically.

- useContext()
Similar to react-redux.
Allows you to access and update the global context state through the React context API.

- useReducer()
Similar to react-redux.
Allows you update the local component state through redux actions and reducers.
DOES NOT update state globally by itself.
